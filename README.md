## Monitoring SSL Certificates in Jenkins Master

### Overview

To ensure the smooth operation and security of our Jenkins master, we have implemented a monitoring solution for SSL certificates. This solution helps us track and manage the expiration dates of all certificates, ensuring timely renewals and avoiding service disruptions.

### Implementation Details

### 1. Raised a Ticket

I initiated the process by raising a ticket with our team to request the setup of an SSL certificate monitoring system for the Jenkins master.

### 2. Configuration of Grafana Dashboard

Our team configured a Grafana dashboard that monitors and displays the SSL certificates. This dashboard provides a comprehensive view of all certificates, including their expiry dates.

### 3. Dashboard Features

The Grafana dashboard includes the following features:

- **SSL Certificates Overview**: Displays all SSL certificates used by Jenkins master.
- **Expiry Date Tracking**: Shows the expiry dates for each certificate, allowing for proactive management.
- **Alerts and Notifications**: (If applicable) Configures alerts to notify the team of impending expirations.

### Benefits

- **Proactive Monitoring**: Enables us to track SSL certificates actively, ensuring timely renewals.
- **Centralized Management**: Provides a single view of all certificates, simplifying management and oversight.
- **Enhanced Security**: Helps maintain the security of our Jenkins master by avoiding expired certificates.

### Accessing the Grafana Dashboard

### Next Steps

1. Regularly check the Grafana dashboard to monitor SSL certificate status.
2. Configure alerts (if not already done) to receive notifications for upcoming certificate expirations.
3. Document any changes or updates in this Confluence page for future reference.
